# Pride Points
PridePoints is a GNSS game designed to help you explore Melbourne through a new lens while interacting with others in the LGBTQIA+ community.

This project utilises <a href ="https://github.com/zjjdes/position-app">Desmond Zhang's repository 'positioning-app'</a> and is conceptually adaptated from <a href="https://www.queerways.au/"> Queer-ways by LUCIANO and Georgia Keats</a>. Queer-ways is a Melbourne-based collaborative community arts project that actualises the queer cartography of Australia by placing its history onto interactive, digital maps. The information and data used by PridePoints has been downloaded from Queer-ways and is a combination of information from the Australian Queer Archives (AQuA) and community contributions.   PridePoints is based on the stolen lands of the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people of the Kulin Nations. We pay respect to Traditional Owners, Elders and Knowledge Holders of all Indigenous nations and acknowledge the ongoing history of sexual and gender diversity represented within these cultures.
