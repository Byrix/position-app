# Pride Points
PridePoints was created by Sean Brooker, Le-Anne Bannan and Elisa Collings for the RMIT subject Satellite Positioning (GEOM2066) in Semester 2, 2024. The assignment brief was to explore the use of GNSS and Geospatial technologies in mobile device applications; gain basic (or additional) skills in the development of browser-based software applications and create a functioning GNSS Game that can be played by others. This repository hosts a demonstrator version of a GNSS game. PridePoints was designed to allow those who are part of or interested in Melbourne's queer community and history explore our urban environment while interacting with others through games, activities and walking tours. Players use a map to navigate the urban environment and arrive at icons that mark significant places. 'Queer Quests' randomly generate throughout gameplay which represent calculated routes between these places.  It is our hope that through this game, the parties, protests and political activists that changed Melbourne into the inclusive city that it is today are recognised, appreciated and provide inspiration to continue this journey in solidarity.

PridePoints is based on the stolen lands of the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people of the Kulin Nations. We pay respect to Traditional Owners, Elders and Knowledge Holders of all Indigenous nations and acknowledge the ongoing history of sexual and gender diversity represented within these cultures.
