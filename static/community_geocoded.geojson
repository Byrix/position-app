{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": "Working Man Group", "Address": "4 Bean Cafe, 22 High Street Northcote", "Story": "Working Man is a membership based peer support group for Victorian male sex workers who provide services for male clients (M2M). The group has an ongoing membership of nearly 300 workers, built through a volunteer outreach program which has contacted about 3000 workers over five years. Working Man’s output includes the outreach program, onboarding and induction training, an ongoing chat support group, newsletters and information pamphlets on self-care and business acumen as well as social events and monthly support meetings at 4Bean Cafe in Northcote.4 Bean has a warm and welcoming atmosphere, friendly staff and a meeting room at the back to ensure the group’s privacy and confidentiality. The group has been meeting here on a monthly basis since 2016.\n\nWorking Man’s mission comes from the insights generated by a PhD research project, authored in 2013 by Andrew McLane, called “An Evolving Trade? Male Sex Work and the Internet.”\n\nThe name of the group, Working Man, is inspired by the title of a magazine, published between 1984 and 2001 by the legendary Prostitutes Collective of Victoria (PCV) called Working Girl / Worker Boy. The Collective was replaced by a community health program called Resourcing Health and Education (RhED) in 2001. Working Girl / Worker Boy was replaced by a similar magazine called RED Magazine. The Collective, spearheaded by champions of sex worker rights, including Cheryl Overs, was pivotal in changing the way sex work was, and is, perceived in Australia. The group’s mission began with the phrase “No bad whores, only bad laws” to highlight the mundane practical nature of sex-work-as-work, and the way discriminatory legislation targeting sex workers create, exacerbate and perpetuate violence against, and unsafe working conditions for, sex workers. \n\nThe Collective was also a key actor in a number of community health initiatives, including needle exchanges to prevent STIs caused by intravenous drug use and the Sex Worker and HIV Project (1993/1994), a first of its kind in Australia. This project “gave a face to those individuals who had received a positive diagnosis, as a means to openly fight the ongoing discrimination against positive people in the sex industry” as well as “change community and industry attitudes towards positive sex workers to become one of practical support and informed choices, rather than reactionary fear and isolation.”(1)\n\n1.
