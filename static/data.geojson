{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": "100 Years of Queer History at 260 Collins Street", "Address": "260 Collins St, Melbourne VIC 3000", "Story": "Although venues changed, were demolished or rebuilt, 260 Collins Street has over 100 years of queer history. The first even happened the the Vienna Café (1890-1915). A popular venue with theatre celebrities and famous men, The Vienna Café was the site of the 1908 arrest of three men dressed in drag.  Alan McKail (20) Douglas Ogilvie (22) and Tom Page (25) were arrested and charged with behaving indecently in a public place, when they dressed as women and entered the Vienna Café for a private meal. The judge called them \"sexual perverts, or damn young fools\" stating that \"the difference between male and female apparel was one of the cornerstones of civilisation and no one could be allowed to flaunt that convention\".  But this would just be the start of the locations to queer history.  Following various rebuilds and demolition, the construction of the Australian Hotel (1930s-1979) lead to much more overt queer behaviours. The Club Bar on the first floor of the Australian Hotel was a popular gay bar, busy on Friday and Saturday Nights. It was frequented by \"Social Queens\" such as window dressers from Myers and suit wearing \"Travel Industry Queers\".  This contrasted the basement level bar called the Pink Sink and later The Snakepit, a gay venue known for rough trade and butch types. Recently released prisoners were known to solicit sex work at Snake Pit and there were cases of theft. There was little cross over between the patrons of the bars, but as these venue closed early due the laws at the time, the pavement of Collins Street was filled with queers quietly exchanging the address of secret parties where they could continue to socialise and even dress in drag.  The Tatler Theatre on the bottom level of the Australia Hotel was also a beat popular with queer men. On the 17th of February, 1951, Edward Meyer (27) was arrested for offensive behaviour after groping a police officer in the theatre. Initially grabbing the policeman's thigh, before moving his hand, Meyer is reported to have said \"'I haven't much time today. We'll have to hurry. I've done enough for one day and time is short\". He was fined and jailed for 14 days,In 1970, The Snakepit was renovated and renamed the Woolshed in hopes of attracting a heterosexual crowd.  The new rugged interiors inspired by the Australian outback were a hit with the cruising gays who had frequented The Snakepit.  Quickly the Woolshed became the 'the best known meeting place for gay people' in Melbourne. The renovation although not deterring the queer patronage, did change the image of the bar and patrons from the City Bar upstairs began going downstairs to the Woolshed and vice versa. After ten years the Woolshed closed on the 8 September 1979, its closure punctuated by the arrest of Terry Stokes and Darren Turner outside the venue for kissing. Both were later charged with offensive behaviour in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court. In 1988-92 the Australia Hotel and the Royal Arcade Hotels were demolished, being replaced by Australia-on-Collins. Still the gays could not be uttered, and the men's bathrooms became a cruising site for office workers during their lunch breaks. The site was closed in 2014, demolished and redeveloped as St Collins Lane, which has continued to be cruising location.

The church holds important meaning for its longstanding mission to support LGBTIQ+ people, especially during the AIDS crisis. In 1980 St Mark’s appointed a social worker, Peter Burke, to run emergency relief and a community lounge. From there, the church began a more active collaboration with its surrounding communities. It hired out its hall to gay groups for meetings at a time when many organisations found that idea objectionable or too controversial. A fundraiser for Gay Community News was hosted there in May 1980, nearly a year before decriminalisation was implemented in Victoria. Beginning in the mid-1980s, St Mark’s ran an AIDS ministry, offering pastoral services and advocacy for people living with HIV and AIDS. Its annual AIDS requiem, held from 1986 and throughout the 1990s, was an important event for many people living with AIDS, drawing crowds of about 500 at its peak.\nA new phase began in 2012 when the first Midsumma Mass was held at St Mark’s. Commencing in 1996. In 2014, St Mark’s vicar Father Stuart Soley delivered an apology to LGBTIQ+ communities. The church’s steeple was lit up in the colour purple as a symbol of apology to LGBTIQ+ communities and to people with HIV/AIDS who have also been subjected to the same ill- informed stigmatisation by the church.

We were having our fun playing a game when we were interrupted by two completely naked young men prancing through the shrubbery. They screamed when they spotted us and quickly moved out of sight.  It wasn't scary, just surprising. We didn't say anything, they didn't mean any harm and weren't doing anything inappropriate, we had just stumbled in at the wrong time. It took me years to work out that the men were likely queer, much of the shoreline was a meeting place for queer men and I imagine that those men were just enjoying being able to be themselves.  Being gay was illegal at the time, so it was kind of their only option.

It was also somewhere I could meet new people, I even met a couple of crushes and flings. The Queer Department also had an annual Queer Ball in the city which was raucous fun.

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "Name": "Working Man Group", "Address": "4 Bean Cafe, 22 High Street Northcote", "Story": "Working Man is a membership based peer support group for Victorian male sex workers who provide services for male clients (M2M). The group has an ongoing membership of nearly 300 workers, built through a volunteer outreach program which has contacted about 3000 workers over five years. Working Man’s output includes the outreach program, onboarding and induction training, an ongoing chat support group, newsletters and information pamphlets on self-care and business acumen as well as social events and monthly support meetings at 4Bean Cafe in Northcote.4 Bean has a warm and welcoming atmosphere, friendly staff and a meeting room at the back to ensure the group’s privacy and confidentiality. The group has been meeting here on a monthly basis since 2016.\n\nWorking Man’s mission comes from the insights generated by a PhD research project, authored in 2013 by Andrew McLane, called “An Evolving Trade? Male Sex Work and the Internet.”\n\nThe name of the group, Working Man, is inspired by the title of a magazine, published between 1984 and 2001 by the legendary Prostitutes Collective of Victoria (PCV) called Working Girl / Worker Boy. The Collective was replaced by a community health program called Resourcing Health and Education (RhED) in 2001. Working Girl / Worker Boy was replaced by a similar magazine called RED Magazine. The Collective, spearheaded by champions of sex worker rights, including Cheryl Overs, was pivotal in changing the way sex work was, and is, perceived in Australia. The group’s mission began with the phrase “No bad whores, only bad laws” to highlight the mundane practical nature of sex-work-as-work, and the way discriminatory legislation targeting sex workers create, exacerbate and perpetuate violence against, and unsafe working conditions for, sex workers. \n\nThe Collective was also a key actor in a number of community health initiatives, including needle exchanges to prevent STIs caused by intravenous drug use and the Sex Worker and HIV Project (1993/1994), a first of its kind in Australia. This project “gave a face to those individuals who had received a positive diagnosis, as a means to openly fight the ongoing discrimination against positive people in the sex industry” as well as “change community and industry attitudes towards positive sex workers to become one of practical support and informed choices, rather than reactionary fear and isolation.”(1)\n\n1.
